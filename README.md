The `nx-python` plugin allows users to create a basic python application using `nx` commands. To add the plugin to your project, just follow these steps:

## Getting started

### Create a Nx Workspace

Before installing the `nx-python` plugin, it is required to have a pre-configured Nx Workspace . If you don't, then proceed to create a new one executing the following command:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace python-workspace --preset=empty --cli=nx --nx-cloud true
cd python-workspace
```

### Install the `nx-python` plugin

```bash
yarn add -D @nx-python/nx-python
```

### Adding an application to our workspace

To create a new python application based on this plugin, please execute the following command:

```bash
nx g @nx-python/nx-python:app <app-name>
```

**Note:** Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your new application

### Advanced options

* `--tags` or `-t` list of tags for project (used for linting)
* `--description` Description of project
* `--repoUrl` Repository URL
* `--directory` or `-d` A directory where the project is placed
* `--template` or `-f` python framework to use (f.ex `django` or `flask`, where `python` is used by default)

#### Create Flask app

```bash
nx g @nx-python/nx-python:app <app-name> --template flask
```

#### Create Django app

```bash
nx g @nx-python/nx-python:app <app-name> --template django
```

### Advanced configuration

The plugin supports [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig) for global configuration.

Simply add a `.nx-pythonrc` file to the root of your monorepo.
Currently this configuration support specifying command options to be used

```json
{
  "python": "python3",
  "commands": {
    "serve": "flask run",
    "lint": "-m pylint",
    "test": "-m pytest",
  }
}
```

See `src/utils/commands.ts` for command examples

You can also specify project specific command overrides in `workspace.json` project entries or in `project.json` per project

```json
"my-app": {
  "python": "python3",
  "commands": {
    "serve": "flask run",
    "lint": "-m pylint",
    "test": "-m unittest discover -s ./ -p",
  }
}
```

## Usage

After creating the `<app-name>` application using the `nx-python` plugin. We can execute the build, lint, test and serve `nx commands` on this new application. Output will be stored on `dist/<app-name>/` directory.

### Building the app

The `build` command is going to compile all the python files inside `<app-name>` directory, using the `py_compile` native module.

```bash
nx build <app-name>
```

More information here: [py_compile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html)

### Linting the application

Unfortunately Python doesn't have a native linting module(yet!).
It is required that you install the linting module beforehand.

After you have installed the linting module you can perform the lint process with:

```bash
nx lint <app-name>
```

### Flake8

`nx-python` uses the `Flake8` module by default to lint your application.

More info here: [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

```bash
pip install Flake8
```

### Serving the application

This is going to execute the main file in your python application.

```bash
nx serve <app-name>
```

For flask and django, the main file is `manage.py`

### Testing your application

The `test` command is going to execute all the test units inside your python app. You can add new test unit files.

To test your python app, execute the command:

```bash
nx test <app-name>
```

### Unittest

If you are using the default native `unittest` python module to for tests:

* The filename must include the prefix `test`

See more info here: [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Dependency Graph

`packages/project-graph` includes some code which detects python projects and adds modified files in python projects to the dependency graph for the project.

To detect a python project it must either:

* have one or more python files (`.py` extension)
* have `"compiler": "python"` set in project `build` options
